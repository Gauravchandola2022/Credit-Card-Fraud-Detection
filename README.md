# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. Fraudulent transactions can lead to significant financial losses for both individuals and financial institutions. Therefore, developing accurate fraud detection models is crucial to mitigate such risks.

Project Overview
Credit card fraud detection involves identifying transactions that are not initiated by the genuine cardholder but rather by unauthorized individuals. This project utilizes logistic regression, a popular classification algorithm, to distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.
